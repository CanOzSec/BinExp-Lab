# BinExp-Lab
This is the docker container I do binary exploitation on.

# Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:CanOzSec/BinExp-Lab.git
cd BinExp-Lab
chmod +x ./build.sh
chmod +x ./run.sh
chmod +x ./shell.sh
./build.sh
```

# Usage

After building the container use ./run.sh to run the container and get shell with ./shell.sh.
You can transfer files between host and container with the directory created named `host`.
